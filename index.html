                <h3>It All Started with that Gorilla</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph"> 2016 was a promising year. It started off so well, with a nice bang. Lots of positive things were happening and were expected to happen. But, little did we know that the first trouble free month of 2016 was just an eleborate ruse.

                    A negligent parent dangled her child over a zoo exhibit. The young boy fell into the exhibit and was picked up by an adult male gorilla named Harambe. Harambe took the child and dragged him around for a while in the exhibit and while the boy suffered only mild injuries, the gorilla was shot dead. Animal rights activists seized on the lack of tranquilzer and just like that, the first major meme of 2016 was born. "Save Harambe!"</p>

                <h3>Funny story</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph"> So once upon a time there was an orange business man. An extreme fan of all things gold, he built a business empire upon his name. He then entered the race for the presidential nomination and somehow emerged as a front runner. It was quite a shocking and, indeed, troubling development for many.

                    He had consistently firey rhetoric that imspired waves of criticism, concern, and also dismissal. Could this man hold a candle to the experienced political elite?! Most thought no. 

                    </p>

                <h3>What?</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph"> The United Kingdom. It's united and a kingdom AND also a part of the European Union. So get this, somehow a group of legislators and public outreach campaigns manage to convince the country to hold a referendum on leaving the monetary union. So this is a huge deal because the Uk is the second largest economy in the EU and one of the major original founding partners. 

                    So this referendum happens and in an absolutely <i>stunning</i> result, the United Kingdom decides to leave the European Union. You can only imagine the insanity this caused. Crazy political upheaval, monetary devaluation, lots of hurt feelings, lots of shaking heads. The UK stunned the world. At this point everyones kind of like wow all this kind of sucks. 

                </p>

                <h3>For Real.</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph"> The Syrian civil war goes into its sixth year. Over 600,000 people are dead and approximately 30 million are displaced. The Assad Regime with the backing of Russia launches a massive offensive on the city of Aleppo.

                    Aleppo falls! The Rebel held city is wrested away with extreme prejudice. Rebels and civilians are executed in the streets, many bid their final farewells on social media as cobined Russian and Syrian forces close in on the roughly one square mile patch still held. All are massacred. 

                    </p>

                <h3>Please No!</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph"> North Korea test fires another nuclear weapon.

                    The world condemns it, but takes it in stride.

                    </p>

                <h3>We're Done.</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph"> In a shocking victory, Donald Trump wins the United States Presidential Election. Everyone gives up. Riots in the streets.

                    As if the previous ten months weren't hard enough, the rest of the world shakes their heads and digs deep in an attempt to stomach the results. Trump calls Taiwan, relations with the Chinese government tank. The world freaks out.</p>



                <h3>The World Has Gone Crazy!</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph"> It all started so nicely. We were hopefull, joyus even. Sadly, it was not going to happen. 2016 was a rough year, and so far 2017 has been off to a rocky start.

                    We can survive!

                    </p>
